//Logical Operators

//&& AND OPERATOR - 2 comparisons need to result in true for whole thing to be true

//|| OR OPERATOR true or false operators
/*if (iPhonePrice < budget || wonLottery === true){

//!= NOT OPERATOR or NEGATION
//true becomes false and false becomes true


//to compare a b & c
//a === b && b ===c

//relational operators are in between pairs
//logical operators go in between relational expressions pr boolean values
